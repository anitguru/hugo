## Preface
Welcome back to our exploration of ChatGPT and its artistic capabilities. If you've been following our journey from [the previous articles](http://welcomerain.pub/en/blog/chatgpt2/), *[thank you](https://welcomerain.pub/en/blog/friend-of-medium/)* for your continued interest. Today, we compare the creative outputs of OpenAI's DALL-E and Midjourney, illuminating the unique nuances of each platform.

In the [last article](https://medium.com/welcome-rain/opening-pandoras-box-chatgpt-friend-or-foe-part-2-the-secret-of-pandora-s-box-60a8b2a7d471), we shared the stunning images created by DALL-E, which captured the essence of our generated story. We present a side-by-side comparison with Midjourney's interpretations of the same prompt.

Next, we will ask Midjourney the same prompt to see what we get! 

# Prompt to request the images:
“Create a book cover for a fantasy story titled ‘The Secret of Pandora’s Box’. Feature a mystical twilight forest with an ethereal atmosphere. In the foreground, a young girl with silver hair and sapphire eyes stands before an open, jewel-encrusted box on a jade altar. The box emits a swirl of light and shadows representing spirits like Joy, Sorrow, Wisdom, and Fear, with a central gentle light for Hope. The background should have ancient trees and subtle magical runes. Aim for an enchanting yet slightly ominous mood, capturing the balance between light and dark. Generate four variants, each with a unique interpretation of this mystical and captivating scene, suitable for a fantasy novel cover.”

## Prompt for the Artistic Challenge:
The task was to create a book cover for a fantasy tale, 'The Secret of Pandora's Box.' We envisioned a mystical twilight forest, a silver-haired girl with sapphire eyes, and a jewel-encrusted box on a jade altar. The box was to emit spirits symbolizing different emotions; all centered around a gentle light representing Hope, set against an ancient forest backdrop with magical runes.

## Insights from Midjourney
The Midjourney results were more similar than expected. Look at the final image picture of the script on the box. It doesn't seem English, which aligns with our past experiences where specifying American English had little impact. AI image generators often falter with text, making us request images without words. The outcomes, much like the obedience of children, can be hit or miss.

## Comparison with Less Description
Using only the title 'The Secret of Pandora's Box,' the results were intriguing. Below are the outputs, with DALL-E on the left and Midjourney on the right. How do you interpret these artistic expressions?
