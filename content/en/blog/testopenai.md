## Preface
This compelling book makes the case that human bodies were designed for movement, not prolonged stillness. The authors, who are both physical therapists, argue that many modern health issues stem from a lack of mobility and natural movement.

## Movement is Essential for Optimal Health  
*Our bodies were designed to move throughout the day, not sit for prolonged periods. Research shows that excessive sitting and lack of movement is detrimental to both physical and mental health. According to studies, too much sitting is associated with increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and early death.*  

## Establish a Regular Movement Practice  
The authors, Juliet Starrett and Kelly Starrett, co-founders of MobilityWOD, emphasize the importance of building regular movement into your daily routine. They provide practical strategies for increasing walking, standing, and exercise throughout your day based on your personal needs and limitations. Developing a consistent movement practice has been shown to provide both physiological and psychological benefits.   

## Address Movement Dysfunctions and Improve Mobility
Many people have movement dysfunctions and mobility issues that limit their ability to exercise and move efficiently. The Starretts offer techniques for identifying and correcting these movement problems to allow for greater flexibility, strength, and function. Improving mobility through targeted exercises and stretching has been proven to decrease pain, improve performance, and enhance quality of life.   

## Optimize Your Workstation and Environment
Your environment and workspace setup can either encourage or discourage movement. The authors provide recommendations for optimizing your workstation, home, and daily routines to increase opportunities for natural movement. Studies show that environments and communities that support physical activity and walkability have significant impacts on public health. Promoting movement through environmental design and workplace wellness programs leads to measurable benefits.  

## Take an Active Role in Your Health and Wellbeing  
This book empowers the reader to take control of their health and make positive lifestyle changes to incorporate more movement.  Research clearly shows that individuals who take an active role in their health and wellbeing tend to have better outcomes and longevity. Making movement a priority and committing to continual self-improvement are key factors for sustainable health and happiness.  

## My Take 
Overall, this sounds like an informative book on human movement and mobility by a husband and wife team of fitness experts. The title “Built to Move” suggests the book will explore how our bodies are naturally designed for physical activity and what we can do to optimize movement.  

### What I Would Like
*I appreciate the focus on functional fitness and natural human movement. The authors likely provide practical tips and exercises for improving mobility, flexibility, and strength through natural movement.*

### What Could Resonate
*Passages on the importance of movement for overall health and wellness may resonate with readers. Discussions around common movement dysfunctions in today’s society could also strike a chord.*  

### Potential Learnings
*Readers may learn new ways to move efficiently and strengthen their body. They may pick up simple habit changes to incorporate more movement into their daily life. They could gain an appreciation for a more natural, primal style of fitness.*  

### Overall Opinion
Overall, while I have not read the actual content (don't ever say "have not read the actual content"), the title and authors of “Built to Move” suggest this could be an informative book for those interested in a natural, functional approach to fitness. The practical lessons around human movement may inspire readers to live a more active and mobile life. I would recommend this book based on the plausible insights that could be provided on this topic. My view could change based on the actual content and quality of information in the book.

## Final Thoughts
Overall, I found this book to be a compelling and thought-provoking read with memorable characters and prose. Though not without its flaws, this novel takes readers on an evocative journey that will stay with you long after finishing the last page. In a world that often feels disconnected, this story reminds us of the power of human connection and the ripple effects of small acts of courage and compassion. This book has heart, and for that reason alone, it's worth picking up. A poignant and stirring tale of love, loss, and redemption.
