## Chapter One: A Holiday Wish

A seemingly ordinary family with a fantastical Christmas wish lived in the picturesque village of Evergreen, surrounded by snow-capped hills and glistening streams. Emma and Jack, the Johnson children, were overjoyed to have an Elf on the Shelf visit their house for the holidays.

The kids’ excitement level rose in the days leading up to Christmas. Particularly enthusiastic was Emma, the eldest.

> Please, Mom and Dad, wouldn’t it be possible for us to purchase an [Elf on the Shelf](https://wlr.link/elf-on-a-shelf)?” she begged one cold night, her eyes longing. “The holiday season is almost here!

Both of her parents grinned and gave each other knowing looks. “Beloved, elves have the power to choose their own homes,” her father tenderly emphasized. “The North Pole sends them on a mission to discover the most jolly family.”

Although Emma’s disappointment was obvious, her determination remained unwavering. That night, she wished upon a shining star that an elf would come to their house.

## In Chapter 2, We Make a Mysterious Find
Emma and Jack found something remarkable on a chilly Saturday the following morning. A tiny, naughty elf with a pointed red cap and malicious smile was nestled among their dazzling Christmas tree branches.

Exclaimed, “His name is Elfred!” Jack read the note affixed to the Elf’s verdant coat. It was a joyous occasion for the kids. Their dream had materialized!

Later that night, Emma shared a humorous video with her parents that featured a family that had installed a webcam to observe the antics of their Elf. The Elf began to circle back as soon as the camera crew stepped out of the room. Asking, “Can we do that too?” With enthusiasm in her voice, Emma inquired.

Her folks laughed. “Perhaps Elfred possesses his own brand of magic,” they winked.

## The Third Chapter: Elfred’s Mysterious Nighttime Adventures
Elfred would spring into action every night after the kids went to bed. His job was to bring happiness and preserve the Christmas spirit; he was not your average Elf.

Elfred was often discovered in the most peculiar locations when Emma and Jack were growing up: dangling from the chandelier, tucked away in the cookie jar, or even constructing a little snowman on the ledge.

All the kids loved Elfred’s mischievous pranks. Despite their inability to see him move, they could tell he was brimming with holiday cheer.

## Chapter 4: The Holiday Surprise
On Christmas Eve, the kids came up with a unique plan. To replicate Elfred’s magical performance, they set up a camera like Emma had seen in the video.

Elfred set out on his most magnificent journey to date while they slept, sugarplums whirling around in their imaginations. He grabbed additional toys and placed them around the tree to prepare for his enchanted Christmas display.

The kids were so excited to see what the camera had caught that they ran to it first thing in the morning. They were astounded to see Elfred and the toys enjoying a joyful celebration in the clip.

## Chapter 5: A Wonderful Bid-Farewell
After Christmas Day ended, Elfred prepared to return to the North Pole. Though they missed Dad, the kids were sure he’d return with even more exciting activities next year.

The enchantment of Christmas is within every one of your hearts, Elfred wrote in his parting message. Do not let the flame die out; I will be here forever.

With hearts overflowing with gratitude and excitement, Emma and Jack embraced Elfred as they said their goodbyes. They understood that Elfred served as a constant reminder of the enchantment and mystery of Christmas, going beyond his role as an ordinary elf on the Shelf.

## Finally, A Tradition Is Born
After that first year, the Johnson family looked forward to Elfred’s visits with great anticipation. Emma and Jack looked forward to Elfred’s coming every Christmas because they knew he brought the Christmas spirit—a joyous, awe-inspiring, loving spirit—with him.

In the sleepy little hamlet of Evergreen, one family’s little Christmas wish became an enchanted ritual that continues to provide delight and mirth to future generations.

*The Johnson family finds out in the touching story of Elfred and the Shelf that the real magic of Christmas isn’t in the material things but in the love and happiness shared by everyone. Elfred the Elf teaches Emma and Jack that the best presents are made with the people we love while spreading joy and magic around their house.*
